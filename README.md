# Predict the CO2 emissions and the total energy consumption of Seattle's non residential building

### Mission 

We were asked to forecast the total energy consumption and CO2 emissions of Seattle's non-residential buildings using supervised models.

This exciting project allowed us to dive deeper into Encoding techniques, Pipeline constructions, Metric selection, Cross-validation, among others, and the fine-tuning of several models (Linear Models, Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbors, Decisional Trees, and Ensemble Methods).
